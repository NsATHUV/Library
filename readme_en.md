# Note Repository

[Switch to Chinese](readme_zh)
## Introduction

These are personal notes I make in my daily life, written using Obsidian. Some content is extracted from Rookie Programming. The primary purpose is for personal dual-end synchronization of notes, and of course, I'm also willing to share them with anyone interested.

## Best User Experience

- Add the root directory as a repository to your Obsidian.
- If you are familiar with `git`, you can use `git commands` to update the notes to the latest version.
- If you are using this project by downloading a compressed file, it is recommended to update once a week. Updating daily may result in a less-than-optimal experience due to the cumbersome operation. Please use your discretion.

## Simple `git` Tutorial

> My understanding of git is also superficial, so I'm not sure if I can provide accurate feedback.
> If you encounter any issues downloading through the following method or face any problems during updates, please contact me promptly.

1. Download and install git.
2. Right-click in the blank space of the directory where you want to get this repository.
3. Click on `Open Git Bash here`.
4. Execute the following command:

```shell
git clone https://gitee.com/NsATS/Library.git
```

This command will automatically create a folder named `Library`. For subsequent updates, please enter the `Library` and proceed.

5. For future updates, use the following command in the `Library` folder:

```shell
git pull
```
